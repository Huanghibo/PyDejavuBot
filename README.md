## This bot is under development!!! An audio recognition algorithm is currently being developed. 

PyDejavuBot - Telegram bot, designed for solving music quizzes. The main focus of the bot is stability, speed, and audio recognitions quality. In the beginning, the bot was written on PyTelegramBotApi, but an emergency decision was made to switch to a more stable and powerful library - aiogram.

- [x] Fully asynchronous Telegram bot written in aiogram.
- [ ] Multilanguage supporting : En,  Ru, Kz (WIP)

_*WIP - Working in process_
